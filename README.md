This minimal working example demonstrates the implementation of a base class for unit tests. It follows the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle by:  

- **Automating generic tests** for all supported observables through a superclass.  
- **Allowing custom test cases** for more complex analyzers.  

This approach ensures that unit tests remain concise, maintainable, and scalable while accommodating the flexibility needed for specific analyzer logic.
